* Farmer's problem

Suppose a farmer has 75 acres on which to plant two crops: wheat and barley.
To produce these crops, it costs the farmer (for seed, fertilizer, etc.) $120 per acre
for the wheat and  $210 per acre for the barley. The farmer has $15000 available for expenses.
But after the harvest, the farmer must store the crops while awaiting favourable market
conditions. The farmer has storage space for 4000 bushels. Each acre yields an average of
110 bushels of wheat or 30 bushels of barley.  If the net profit per bushel of
wheat (after all expenses have been subtracted) is $1.30 and for barley is $2.00,
how should the farmer plant the 75 acres to maximize profit?

Let x denote the number of acres allotted to wheat and y the number of acres allotted to barley.
Then the expression to be maximized, that is the profit, is clearly

P = (110)(1.30)x + (30)(2.00)y = 143x + 60y.

There are three constraint inequalities, specified by the limits on expenses, storage and acreage.
They are respectively:

120x + 210y <= 15000
110x + 30y <= 4000
x + y <= 75

Strictly speaking there are two more constraint inequalities forced by the fact that the farmer
cannot plant a negative number of acres, namely:

x >= 0, y >= 0.

* Brewer's problem

Small brewery produces ale and beer.
Production limited by scarce resources:
- corn (480 lbs)
- hops (160 oz)
- barley malt (1190 lbs).
Recipes require different proportions of resources per barrel:
- ale  (corn  5 lbs, hops 4 oz, malt 35 lbs)
- beer (corn 15 lbs, hops 4 oz, malt 20 lbs)
Profit per barrel:
- ale  ($13)
- beer ($23)
Choose product mix to maximize profits.

malt: 35 A + 20 B <= 1190;
